# K Pots
## ðŸ•µðŸ”Ž By KaotickJ ðŸ‘½ 
KPots is a simple honeypots system to capture and log traffic to specified ports.

Syntax: kpots.sh [-h|-d|-i|-s|-v] <PORT>

   options:
   -------------------------------------------
*   -h help message
*   -d <PORT> Deletes logs for specified port.
*   -i <PORT> Generates a new banner for port specified .
*   -s <PORT> To monitor specified port in simple mode.
*   -v <PORT> To monitor soecified port in verbose mode.
### Usage
>  PLEASE NOTE:  K-Pots MUST be run with elevated privileges. Run as root or `sudo ./kpots.sh `

First, you'll need a banner for the port.  K-pots displays the banner text at $DIR/$PORT.txt on connect. The banner genrator relies on figlet: http://www.figlet.org/ , though no extra fonts are required as it uses the default figlet font.

To generate a new banner for a port, for example, ssh on port 22  simply run:
```sh
sudo ./kpots.sh -i 22
```
Or create 22.txt and save your own banner text into it:
```sh
touch 22.txt
nano 22.txt
```
#### A more serious and realistic ssh banner:
>The authenticity of host '10.0.2.41 (10.0.2.41)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:1r8zd7E92Jq4/fDkEXzkFJ5RlQ25g1dPA5edubA1L/U.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

To monitor port 22 for incoming connections and log traffic to 22.log:
```sh
sudo ./kpots.sh -s 22
```
To monitor port 22 for incoming connections, display them in the terminal, and log traffic to $DIR/$PORT/long.log:
```sh
sudo ./kpots.sh -v 22
```
To delete logs for port 22:
```sh
sudo ./kpots.sh -d 22
```
